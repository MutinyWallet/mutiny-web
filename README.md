### Running Mutiny Web

### Dependencies

- pnpm > 8

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Env

The easiest way to get start with development is to create a file called `.env.local` and copy the contents of `.env.example` into it. This is basically identical to the env that `signet-app.mutinywallet.com` uses.

### Testing

We have a couple Playwright e2e tests in the e2e folder. You can run these with:

```
just test
```

Or get a visual look into what's happening:

```
just test-ui
```

### Formatting

Hopefully your editor picks up on the `.prettirrc` file and auto formats accordingly. If you want to format everything in the project run `pnpm run format`.

### Local

If you want to develop against a local version of [the node manager](https://github.com/MutinyWallet/mutiny-node), you may want to `pnpm link` it.

Due to how [Vite's dev server works](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-allow), the linked `mutiny-node` project folder should be a sibling of this `mutiny-web` folder. Alternatively you can change the allow path in `vite.config.ts`.

In your `mutiny-node` local repo:

```
just link
```

(on a Mac you might need to prefix `just link` with these flags: `AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang`)

Now in this repo, link them.

```
just local
```

To revert back and use the remote version of mutiny-wasm:

```
just remote
```

## Android

### How to test locally

```
pnpm build && npx cap sync
```

Now open up the `android` directory in android studio and run the build

### Deploying

#### Pull Requests

Each pull request will build the debug signet app and upload it internally to the github actions run.

#### Master

Each push to master will build a signed release version running in signet mode. The build process is almost identical to the release version.

Prereleased tags will be created for master.

#### Release

First bump up the `versionCode` and `versionName` in `./andriod/app/build.gradle`. The `versionCode` must always go up by one when making a release. The `versionName` can mimic `package.json` with an extra build number like `0.4.3-1` to make it easier to keep things looking like they are in sync when android only releases go out.

Publish a new tag like `0.4.3-1` in order to trigger a signed release version running in mainnet mode.

### Creating keys for the first time

1. Generate a new signing key
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore <my-release-key.keystore> -alias <alias_name> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
openssl base64 < <my-release-key.keystore> | tr -d '\n' | tee some_signing_key.jks.base64.txt
```
2. Create 3 Secret Key variables on your GitHub repository and fill in with the signing key information
    - `KEY_ALIAS` <- `<alias_name>`
    - `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD` <- `<your key store password>`
    - `SIGNING_KEY` <- the data from `<my-release-key.keystore>`
3. Change the `versionCode` and `versionName` on `app/build.gradle`
4. Commit and push.
